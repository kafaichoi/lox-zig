# Lox-Zig: A Lox Interpreter in Zig

This is WIP implementation of Lox following the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), written in the Zig programming language.

Currently implemented features:

- Lexical scanning and parsing
- Expression evaluation
- Variables and assignment
- Control flow (if/else, while)
- Functions and closures
- Native functions

This is my first time writing Zig so the code is probably not idiomatic, buggy and slow.
